    <!--image of a duck-->
    <p> I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the  internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, because reasons. 
 </p>
 <p>HTML is cool
 CSS is cooler
 JS is the best</p>
 <p> What do you need to create a website?</p>
 <P> Not much!
A computer (always a good start)
A text editor (I am using caret)
A web browser (I am using chrome)
Some HTML, CSS and JS files</P>
